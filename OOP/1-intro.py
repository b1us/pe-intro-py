# Object-oriented programming
# Not specific to Python, but Python is an OOP language
# Interaction objects within a program

x = 1

# x is an object of type int

y = "some text"

# y is an object of type str

z = [1, 2, 3]

# z is an object of type list

# x, y, z are variables that store the reference to the object of specific type

# we create instances of classes

# class is a blueprint for creating objects

print(type(x)) # <class 'int'>
print(type(y)) # <class 'str'>
print(type(z)) # <class 'list'>

# Class is something that built in Python that defines the behavior of an object (interactions with other objects in the program)
# Exaple:
# x + y # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
