# Interface

# An interface is a contract that a class can implement to conform to a standard way of providing certain kinds of functionality.
# It is a 100% abstract class that contains only abstract methods and static methods.
# (It's really like abstract class but only contain abstract methods)
# Contains no implementation details, no code other than definition of methods and also raise `NotImplementedError` inside every those methods.
# The point of `Interface` is only define and describe all the methods that must be implemented by any class that inherits from it.
# It's really important in `static type` languages like Java, but not that important in Python.
# In Python we can achieve the same thing but not trully an interface.
