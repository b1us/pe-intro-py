# Sets
# Definition of a set is a collection of unique elements in no particular order 
# Sets are mutable, but the elements must be immutable
# Sets are unordered, so you cannot access items using indexes
# Syntax: set_name = {item1, item2, item3, ...}

# Create a set
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(set1)
